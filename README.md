# Interior-Point vs. Spatial Branching Approaches for Solving the AC Optimal Power Flow Problem

The aim of this repository is to provide details of the test systems employed and the approaches applied in the related research titled *Interior-Point vs. Spatial Branching Approaches for Solving the AC Optimal Power Flow Problem*.

## Data Description

The following test systems are included in this repository:
* `case14`, `tuned14`: IEEE 14-bus test systems (original and tuned versions)
* `case39`, `tuned39`: IEEE 39-bus test systems (original and tuned versions)
* `case57`, `tuned57`: IEEE 57-bus test systems (original and tuned versions)
* `case118`, `tuned118`: IEEE 118-bus test systems (original and tuned versions)

*Tuned variants incorporate modifications from Narimani et al. (2018) (14- and 57-bus) and Bukhsh et al. (2013) (39- and 118-bus) to enhance the presence of local minima.*
