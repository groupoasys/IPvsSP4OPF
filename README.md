# IPvsSP4OPF

The aim of this repository is to provide details of the test systems used in the related research titled *Interior-Point vs. Spatial Branching Approaches for Solving the AC Optimal Power Flow Problem*.

## Data Description

The following test systems in MATPOWER format are included in this repository:

`case14.m`: IEEE 14-bus test system.  
`tuned14.m`: Modified version of the 14-bus system incorporating adjustments from Narimani et al. (2018) to induce additional local minima.  

`case39.m`: IEEE 39-bus test system.  
`tuned39.m`: Modified version of the 39-bus system incorporating adjustments from Bukhsh et al. (2013) to enhance non-convex behavior.  

`case57.m`: IEEE 57-bus test system.  
`tuned57.m`: Modified version of the 57-bus system following Narimani et al. (2018) to introduce challenging local minima.  

`case118.m`: IEEE 118-bus test system.  
`tuned118.m`: Modified version of the 118-bus system based on Bukhsh et al. (2013) to create multiple feasible and near-optimal operating points.
