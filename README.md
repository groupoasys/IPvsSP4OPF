# {{ Interior-Point vs. Spatial Branching Approaches for Solving the AC Optimal Power Flow Problem }}

The aim of this repository is to provide details of the test systems employed and the approaches applied in the related research titled *Interior-Point vs. Spatial Branching Approaches for Solving the AC Optimal Power Flow Problem*.

## Data Description

The following test systems are included in this repository:
* `case14`, `tuned14`: IEEE 14-bus test systems (original and tuned versions)
* `case39`, `tuned39`: IEEE 39-bus test systems (original and tuned versions)
* `case57`, `tuned57`: IEEE 57-bus test systems (original and tuned versions)
* `case118`, `tuned118`: IEEE 118-bus test systems (original and tuned versions)

*Tuned variants incorporate modifications from Narimani et al. (2018) (14- and 57-bus) and Bukhsh et al. (2013) (39- and 118-bus) to enhance the presence of local minima.*
